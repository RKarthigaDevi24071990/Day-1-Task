Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

OBJECTS:
=> Objects is the combination of Primitive Data types as well as reference data types.
=> Objects can be created using Object Constructor or Object Initializer.
=> Objects are variables too but it contains only values.
=> Objects in JavaScript is defined as the unordered collection of data of primitive or reference types of("Key:value")pairs.
=> Java Script objects is a non primitive data types that allows you to store multiple collection of data.

INTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF JAVA SSRIPT:
=> The syntax for adding property to an object:
ObjectName.Objectproperty = property value;

=> The syntax for deleting property to an object:
delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;

=> The syntax to access a property from an Object:
ObjectName.Property
or ObjectName[Expressions];

=> Object Methods:
function(){return ignition.on};

=> Using new Keyword:
obj = New Object();
obj.key1 = value1;
obj.key2 = value2;
